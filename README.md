ZooKeeper

This project will teach you how to take user commands and display animal information, making you feel like a real zookeeper. You'll use lists to organize your data and loops to keep the program running. In the end, you'll have a fun, interactive tool that shows off your new Python skills and lets you explore the animal kingdom from your screen.
